(* A note on array bounds checks. In OCaml, a call [Array.get a i] is always
   checked, a call [Array.unsafe_get a i] is never checked, and an array access
   expression [a.(i)] is checked if and only if the compile-time flag [-unsafe]
   is not passed. In the code that follows, we use the latter form. When
   processed by CFML, without [-unsafe], this form is translated to
   [Array.get a i], and we prove that the array index is within bounds. When
   compiled with OCaml, we pass [-unsafe], so the check is not performed. *)

(* In this code, array indices are always within bounds, even if the client is
   unverified. This claim is informal, though; at present, we cannot explicitly
